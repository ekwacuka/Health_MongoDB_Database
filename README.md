# MongoDB

1. Created a MongoDB database connection to a HEALTH database that resides in the Cloud and also local to my system.

2. In the HEALTH MongoDB Database created two collections using Python and MongoDB.

         a) Hospital Table
             Hospital_Id
             Hospital_Name
             Bed_Count
             Address

         b) Doctor Table
             Doctor_Id 
             Doctor_Name
             Hospita_Id 
             Date_Joined
             Salary
             Experience

      
3. Joined these two collections and then printed the joined Collections.
