# MongoDB

1. Created a MongoDB database connection to a HEALTH database that resides in the Cloud and also local to my system.

2. In the HEALTH MongoDB Database created two collections
   a): Hospital and b): Doctors, using Python and MongoDB.

      a) Hospital Table
          Hospital_Id
          Hospital_Name
          Bed_Count
          Address
          
      b) Doctor Table
          Doctor_Id 
          Doctor_Name
          Hospita_Id 
          Date_Joined
          Salary
          Experience

      
3. Joined these two collections and then printed the joined Collections.

4. Displayed the output of Doctor Collection and that of Hospital collection separately using HTML table.
